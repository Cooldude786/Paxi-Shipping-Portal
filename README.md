# Project Title: **PAXI**

## Project Overview

**Objective:**

Re-platforming the back-end infrastructure of a popular and fast growing counter-to-counter parcel delivery service of South Africa from its original legacy on-premise hosting solution to a modern, serverless cloud-hosted back-end so that it can continue to scale at it’s current rapid pace.

## Contributions

- Developed the entire portal’s web design following mobile first design approach to ensure native app like experience for mobile users with the help of HTML and CSS.
- Implemented a user authentication system for account creation, login, and password recovery.
- I have developed the account management, parcel registration, and parcel management features of the app.
- Integrated Barcode scanning functionality using native javascript and media api’s of browser to scan the parcel numbers eliminating the hassle of manually entering parcel number.
- I have integrated and written the initial code structure of the app considering the SOLID principles of the development ensuring reusability.
- Also, have created a reusable OTP-Input and select country library specially for the app ensuring it can be used elsewhere in some other project too.
- Moreover, I have written the responsive css for the app ensuring it look attractive for every screen size.

## Achievements and Results

This project allowed me to develop, project management, and organisational skills. I also learned about good practice to write a code which can be scalable and have learnt about state management library called NgRx which is first choice among angular developers. Furthermore, I also learned how to work in a scrum methodology and to participate in a daily scrum ceremonies along with using JIRA for task management.

## Technologies Used

- Front-End: HTML5, CSS3, Angular 15, TypeScript, NgRx
- Back-End: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Cloud Hosting: Google Cloud Platform
